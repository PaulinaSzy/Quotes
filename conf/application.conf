# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# ~~~~~

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
#
# This must be changed for production, but we recommend not changing it in this file.
#
# See http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret for more details.

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
play.i18n.langs = [ "en", "pl" ]

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# play.http.router = my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
# Remember to update the database path before enabling this option!
#db.default.url="jdbc:h2:/d:/dev/play-lecture/edukacja2-v1/edu2database"
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
db.default.username=sa
db.default.password=""

ebean.default = ["models.*"]


# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
#play.evolutions.enabled=false

# You can disable evolutions for a specific datasource if necessary
play.evolutions.db.default.autoApply=true

# Required for local javascripts to run
play.filters.headers {
  contentSecurityPolicy = "connect-src 'self' ws://localhost:9000"

# The dots in play.filter.hosts can be replaced with curly braces e.g.
# play {
#   filters {
#     hosts {
#        allowed = ["..."]
#     }
